# One more ML framework will fix all problems

Which is why I decided to start making one :)
Working on [Tensorlib](https://github.com/tanmaysachan/tensorlib) just to brush up my C++.

Original insipiration for it was [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad). While tinygrad started off
as an ambitious project - write good software for *any* *accelerator to run - I feel it has devolved a little into
an obfuscation contest to reduce the number of lines in its codebase. Still a great project though, just feels a
little unapproachable to me.

I want tensorlib to be an educational project, for me or anyone reading the codebase. Will work on that after I
finally manage to add two tensors.
