# Contravariance and Profunctors


#### Functor

Functors are used to map categories. In haskell they are defined as:

```haskell
class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

```

And they follow the laws:  
1. `fmap id = id`
2. `fmap (g . f) = fmap g . fmap f`

#### Bifunctor

Bifunctor is a functor whose domain is a product category. A functor $F: C_1 \times C_2 \rightarrow D$ is a Bifunctor.

```haskell
class Bifunctor f where
    bimap :: (a -> c) -> (b -> d) -> f a b -> f c d
```

they also follow similar laws:  
1. `bimap id id = id`
2. `bimap (f . g) (h . i) = bimap f h . bimap g i`


## Contravariance

When we have some functor $F: C \rightarrow D$, $F$ is covariant to objects in $C$. Covariance and Contravariance here can be differentiated through type [polarity](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/polarity+in+type+theory), which essentially states whether the type is the output or the input to a function.

Example of contravariant object:  

```haskell
newtype Predicate a = Predicate { runPredicate :: a -> Bool }
```

We cannot use a functor to map Predicate, since it is `Contravariant` in type `a`. Instead, we can introduce "Contravariant functor" to solve this.

```haskell
class Contravariant f where
    contramap :: (b -> a) -> f a -> f b

instance Contravariant Predicate where
    contramap f (Predicate p) = Predicate (p . f)
```

## Profunctor

While a Bifunctor is covariant in its type parameters, a Profunctor is covariant in its right type parameter and contravariant in its left type parameter.

```haskell
class Profunctor p where
    dimap :: (a -> b) -> (c -> d) -> p b c -> p a d

```

Laws are similar to bifunctor:  
1. dimap id id = id
2. dimap (h . f) (g . i) = dimap f g . dimap h i

Profunctors can model the function arrow:

```haskell
instance Profunctor (->) where
    dimap ab cd bc = cd . bc . ab

```  
(Where ab is of type (a -> b), and similarly for cd and bc)

`Lens` also composes through profunctors, and I'll probably write about it when I understand it better.
