# Virtual Water

Countries requiring assistance to fix water shortage do not import water directly, as it is heavy and difficult/expensive to transport. Instead they `export` livestock and crops which consume a lot of water (like wheat, rice and sheeps). The water that is saved as a result is referred to as "virtual water" ([link](https://wmc.landfood.ubc.ca/webapp/VWM/course/food-export-virtual-water/introduction/)).

Fiji is the only country whose #1 export is "actual" water, and this is because of Fiji bottled water.
