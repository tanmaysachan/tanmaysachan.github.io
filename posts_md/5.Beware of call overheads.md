# Beware of call overheads

String functions are a prevalent bottleneck in high performance routines, due to which functions like C's `strcmp` are written in 
hand optimized [assembly](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/x86_64/strcmp.S;h=c5c44d4e27710c0c335f581cf42de37b3eefc9f4;hb=fdfc9260b61d3d72541f18104d24c7bcb0ce5ca2).

`strcmp` quits as soon as a character mismatch is detected in the string. The following loop is used to benchmark its performance:  

```C++
volatile int common_strings = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
        if (!strcmp(strs[i], strs[j]))
            common_strings++;
```  
Runtime for N = 50000: 11.24 seconds

While it is performant, if the hit rate is low (eg - associative array), a simple first char check ends up giving a 2x performance boost:

```C++
volatile int common_strings = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
        if (*strs[i] == *strs[j] && !strcmp(strs[i], strs[j]))
            common_strings++;
```  
Runtime for N = 50000: 4.84 seconds
