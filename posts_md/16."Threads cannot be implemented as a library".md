# "Threads cannot be implemented as a library"

We often take multi-threading for granted, given its prevalence in modern systems.
Data races are often ridiculously tricky, and designing language specs around it even more so.

I was recently reading a paper(title is the same as this post's[1]) which goes into
depth about why optimizing compilers find dealing with multi-threading exceptionally hard - especially arguing
that creation of thread functionality as a library (i.e. uninvolved with the compiler implementation) is
impossible.  

Multithreading as a feature must be baked into the language, the earlier in its life-cycle, the better (which
tells us why C/C++ data race specs pre-2011 were just UB, Java's are still ridiculously complex,
and within safe Rust they're impossible to create).
